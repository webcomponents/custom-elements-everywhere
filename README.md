# ️Custom Elements Everywhere 🍻

## Installation

To install all dependencies and build the site:

```bash
npm run install-all

# You'll see errors during this next step because some of the framework tests
# fail. That's by design, so don't worry! At the end it should print the
# message "Site built successfully!". If you don't see that then something
# actually did break :P

npm run build

npm start
```

## What is this?

Karma tests for each of the major frameworks to see how they handle working
with Web Components.
