<h4 id="ember-handling-data">Handling data</h4>

Because attributes must be strings, Ember requires that, if an attribute is desired,
its value be a string, otherwise data is passed as properties to the element instance.

<h4 id="ember-handling-events">Handling events</h4>

Ember can listen to native DOM events dispatched from Custom Elements.
It supports all styles of events (lowercase, camelCase, kebab-case, etc).
