            <p>
              Custom Elements are the lynchpin in the Web Components
              specifications. They give developers the ability to define their
              own HTML elements. When coupled with Shadow DOM, Custom Elements
              should be able to work in any application. But things don't always
              work seamlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project runs a suite of tests against each framework to
              identify interoperability issues, and highlight potential fixes
              already implemented in other frameworks. If frameworks agree on
              how they will communicate with Custom Elements, it makes
              developers' jobs easier; they can author their elements to meet
              these expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Custom Elements and Shadow DOM don't come with a pre-defined set
              of best practices. The tests in this project are a best guess as
              to how things should work, but they're by no means final. This
              project is also about driving discussion and finding consensus, so
              don't be afraid to
              <a href="https://github.com/omijs/cee">open a GitHub issue</a>
              to discuss places where the tests could be improved. ✌️

                What are these custom element things?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Custom elements are a new web standard which let developers
                create their own HTML Elements. Because they're based on web
                standards, these elements should work on any page. This means,
                you can write a component, like a datepicker, and share it
                everywhere.

                Are you testing that libraries let you author custom elements?
              </h3>
              <p>
                No. These tests just check that a library/framework supports the
                <em>usage</em> of custom elements. Essentially we're trying to
                answer the question: "If you're building an app in framework X,
                and you'd like to include a few custom elements on the page, are
                you going to have a bad time?"
              </p>
              <p>
                The tests check that the library/framework will let you do
                things like display a custom element, bind data to it, pass in
                children, and listen for events.

                Why is each test counted twice?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Each test is run on a browser with native support for all of the
                web components standards (template, shadow DOM, custom elements)
                and on a browser with polyfilled support. It's possible that a
                test may work in the native setting and not in the polyfilled
                one, or vice versa. To account for this, we count both
                environments as unique tests.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Each test has an associated weight, based on how critical it is.
                The final tally of pass/fails is combined with these weights to
                create a weighted average score.

              <h3 class="title is-4" id="faq-basic-advanced-different">
                How are basic and advanced tests different?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Basic tests cover things which are fundamental to a
                library/framework's ability to display a custom element. For
                example, can it display a custom element that contains shadow
                DOM? Can it handle setting attributes on the custom element? Can
                it listen for DOM events from the element? Failing any of these
                tests is a pretty critical issue.
              </p>
              <p>
                Advanced tests cover more opinionated framework features. For
                example, does the framework provide declarative syntax for
                listening to events with different casing styles (kebab-case,
                camelCase, etc). These are more like "nice to haves" that may
                improve the developer experience.
              </p>

            <div class="question">
              <h3 class="title is-4" id="faq-polymer">
                I thought the whole point of Polymer was to write custom
                elements. Why doesn't it get a 100%?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Polymer supports a non-standard feature called declarative event
                binding, which lets you use attributes to wire up event
                listeners. E.g. <code>&lt;my-element
                on-foo="handleFoo"&gt;</code>. Because DOM events are just
                strings, there are no rules governing how they should be
                formatted or capitalized—"my-event" is just as reasonable as
                "myEvent" or "myevent". Even the web platform has a few examples
                of oddly cased events like <code>DOMContentLoaded</code>.
                Because Polymer's implementation of declarative event bindings
                relies on pulling the event name from the <code>on-*</code>
                attribute, and the HTML parser will <em>always lowercase
                attribute names</em>, it is unable to listen for events with
                capital letters in their names.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since it is entirely possible to write a vanilla custom element
                that dispatches an event with a capital letter in its name, and
                because there is prior art in the platform that actually uses
                this technique for event names with acronyms ("DOM"), we feel it
                is important to test this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Libraries like Preact also fail these capitalization tests,
                which points to a possible best practice of always making event
                names lowercase. This is the style most DOM events already use:
                <code>mousedown, popstate, beforeunload</code>, etc.
              </p>

            <div class="question">
              <h3 class="title is-4" id="faq-missing-feature">
                If a library is missing a feature, like declarative event or
                property bindings, does it automatically fail those tests?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Not necessarily. If a library omits a
                <strong>non-standard</strong> feature aimed at developer
                ergonomics, e.g. declarative event/property bindings, we would
                just omit those tests from the scoring process.
              </p>

                Why don't you have tests for _____ library?
              </h3>
              <p>
                We'd like to have as much test coverage as possible, but it's
                a fair bit of work building each test suite (especially because
                we are not experts in every library). If a framework or library
                is not represented it's just because we haven't had a chance to
                write tests for it yet.

              <p>
                Yes! In fact, >50% of the tests on this site are from external
                contributors.
